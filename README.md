Advanced-HTML5-Video-Player
===========================

Here is an HTML player which is currently under development.

**THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETLY EXPERAMENTAL AND WILL LACK SEVERAL FEATURES**

Useage
======

1) Download the **video-player** folder and copy and paste the code from **index.html** and into your document.

2) Edit the several `source` tags inside the `video` element. It is reccomended to do all three and convert the videos to MP4, WebM and Ogg Theora because it will support much older browsers.

3) Copy and paste the folowing code **beneath** the code that you coppid down earlier.

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="video-player/stylesheet.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="video-player/javascript.js"></script>
    
That should be it, you should be good to go now, If you do have any issues with it though, please open an issue so I can help you out.
